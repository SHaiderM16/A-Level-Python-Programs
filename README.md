# Python Programs

This repository contains a collection of Python programs developed as part of my A-Level Computer Science curriculum. The projects cover a range of topics, from basic algorithms and data structures to more advanced concepts like file handling and object-oriented programming.

## Contents

- **Basic Algorithms**: Fundamental algorithms for sorting, searching, and problem-solving.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of common data structures such as lists, stacks, circular queues, binary trees, and linked lists.
- **File Handling**: Programs demonstrating how to read from and write to files.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Examples of classes, objects, inheritance, and other OOP concepts.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository with:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
